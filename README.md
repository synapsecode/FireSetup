# Flutter FireSetup Utility (1.0.1)

A Simple Automated way of Adding Firebase to your flutter project! Makes the process easy as you do not need to individually go into each file and add code snippets! The script takes care of that for you!

You can use this tool with my [FireAuth](https://github.com/synapsecode/fireauth) package to effortlessly integrate Firebase Authentication in flutter.

This script was made in Python 3.9!
  

<br>

## System Requirements

* Windows 10 or macOS (Linux Untested)
* Python 3 (if not present, please install python3)

# Usage


### 游리 Step 1: Create a flutter project

```batch

flutter create testapp

cd testapp

```

---

### 游리 Step 2: Create a Firebase Project (or) Open an Existing One

Use the Firebase Console to do this! It's very straightforward

---

### 游리 Step 3: Add an Android App in Firebase Console

- Register the App
- Save the google_services.json file in android/app
- Click Next and do not proceed with editing any other files as This will be done by FireSetup

---

### 游리 Step 4: Add an iOS App in Firebase Console

- Register the App
- Save the GoogleService-Info.plist file somewhere
- Keep Clicking Next and do not proceed with editing any other files as This will be done by FireSetup
- Open the ios folder in XCode and drag and drop the Plist file under Runner and check 'Copy if needed'

---

### 游리 Step 5: Add Web App in Firebase Console

- Register the App
- From the code snippet provided by firebase, just copy the firebaseConfig object and save it somewhere
- Click Next and do not proceed with editing any other files as This will be done by FireSetup

---


### 游리 Step 6: Run FireSetup (Firebase Mode)
This adds firebase to your flutter project! If you do not use Auth you can stop right here! Firebase has been added to your project!

- Inside your flutter project, open terminal and enter this command (assuming you have installed FireSetup Correctly):
```bash

firesetup firebase

```
- You can use platform flags like -a, -i or -w to install for a specific platform like Android, iOS or Web specifically! By Default it installs on all platforms.
- You can combine multiple flags like -a -i will install for android and ios while excluding web and so on

---

### 游리 Step 6.1: Run FireSetup (Auth Mode)
This adds FirebaseAuth Support to your project! This is necessary if you plan on using FirebaseAuth in your flutter project

* Inside your flutter project, open terminal and enter this command (assuming you have installed FireSetup Correctly):

```bash

firesetup auth

```
- (Email, Phone, Google, Anonymous, OAuth2(Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Yahoo)) support is added in all cases!
- You can use the platform flags (-a, -i or -w) to add Auth Support only to specific platforms
- You can use the -all flag to add support for all AuthProviders (Currently only Facebook is added, AppleID may come soon)
- You can add specific AuthProviders too using the -p argument with a value like '[Facebook]' and so on (no spaces)
- You can combine multiple flags based on your requirements!
- To use google sign in on web, you need to pass your GoogleSignInClientID when prompted. You can get instructions for this below in the Additional Setup section.
- For Facebook, you need to provide your AppID and ClientToken to FireSetup. You can get instructions for this below in the Additional Setup section.
  
---

### 游리 Step 6.2: Add firebaseConfig to Web

- Open the flutter project using an IDE like VSCode for example
- Go to the /web/index.html file and replace the commented firebaseConfig object there with the one you copied when adding Firebase to Web in the Firebase Console

---

  

### 游리 Step 7: Enable Authentication Methods

- Head over to the Authentication Section of your Firebase Project's Console
- Click on Get Started
- Go to the SignIn Method Tab
- Enable whichever Auth Provider you need!
- Additional setup needed for each of the Auth Providers is shown below under 'Additional Setup Instructions'

---

  

### 游댯 Testing

```

flutter pub get

```

* Write Some Code

* Run the Application

  

```
